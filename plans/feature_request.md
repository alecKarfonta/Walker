Are the neural networks of sufficient size to learn this task?
- [x] When I click a robot it should become the focused robot ✅ **FIXED**: Corrected Box2D coordinate system transformation (15x scale factor)

- [x] FPS counter in frontend (show UI and physics engine FPS) ✅ **WORKING**: Both UI and Physics FPS displayed with color coding

### Q-Learning & Elite Robot Persistence 🧠✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Q-learning weights preserved on robot respawn ✅ **CONFIRMED**: Learning state maintained via neural networks
- [x] Elite robot storage system ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Top 3 performers saved per generation, auto-restore on reload
- [x] Neural network persistence ✅ **FIXED**: Replaced Q-table system with proper neural network state saving
- [x] Neural network training frequency ✅ **FIXED**: Increased from every 10 steps to every 2 steps (5x more training)

### Code Architecture Refactoring 🏗️✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Agent hierarchy simplification ✅ **COMPLETED**: Consolidated 5-class hierarchy into 2 classes (BaseAgent + CrawlingAgent)
- [x] Q-table removal ✅ **COMPLETED**: Eliminated all Q-table dependencies, migrated to pure neural network architecture
- [x] Evolution system modernization ✅ **COMPLETED**: Updated to work with neural networks instead of Q-tables
- [x] Migration verification ✅ **TESTED**: Docker build successful, 60 agents running with attention_deep_q_learning
