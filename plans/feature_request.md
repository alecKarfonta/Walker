- [x] ‚úÖ **COMPLETELY OVERHAULED**: Realistic Terrain Generation System

- [x] ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Only render what is actually in the users view

**IMPLEMENTED**: Viewport-based rendering optimization with frustum culling:

üîç **Viewport Culling System**:
1. **Dynamic Viewport Calculation**: Real-time calculation of world-space viewport bounds based on camera position, zoom level, and canvas dimensions
2. **Object Filtering**: Intelligent filtering of robots, food sources, and obstacles to only include objects visible within the viewport
3. **Performance Optimization**: Significant reduction in rendering workload by culling off-screen objects
4. **Smart Margin System**: Includes buffer zone around viewport edges to handle objects partially visible
5. **Focus Preservation**: Always includes focused agent in rendering even if outside viewport
6. **Toggle Control**: Real-time toggle button to enable/disable culling for performance comparison
7. **Debug Visualization**: Optional viewport bounds overlay for development and testing

üéØ **Technical Implementation**:
- Backend viewport bounds calculation using camera position and zoom
- Object-specific filtering methods for agents, food sources, and obstacles  
- Canvas dimension detection for accurate viewport sizing
- Performance statistics tracking and display
- Conditional rendering based on user preference

üìä **Performance Benefits**:
- Reduces rendering load when zoomed in or viewing specific areas
- Maintains smooth framerates with large numbers of objects
- Real-time culling efficiency statistics display
- Automatic optimization without user intervention required

üõ†Ô∏è **User Interface**:
- "üîç Viewport Culling" toggle button to enable/disable optimization
- "üîç Debug: Bounds" button to visualize viewport boundaries
- Real-time efficiency statistics in performance overlay
- Console logging for culling effectiveness monitoring

‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL RESULT**: Viewport culling was implemented but comprehensive analysis revealed it only affects frontend rendering, not backend simulation bottlenecks.

üîç **PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS ADDED**:
- **Comprehensive profiling system** to identify real bottlenecks
- **Performance reports** every 30 seconds showing time spent in each subsystem
- **Bottleneck identification** with specific optimization recommendations
- **Frame rate analysis** showing percentage of frames meeting 60 FPS target

üìä **Key Finding**: The viewport culling only reduces data sent to frontend. The real performance bottlenecks are:
1. **Physics simulation** - All agents still physically simulated regardless of viewport
2. **AI processing** - All agents still run learning algorithms 
3. **Ecosystem dynamics** - All interactions still calculated
4. **Statistics updates** - All agent data still processed

‚úÖ **AI OPTIMIZATION IMPLEMENTED**: Targeted fix for Agent AI Processing bottleneck

üß† **AI Performance Optimizations Added**:
1. **Batched AI Processing**: Only 25% of agents update AI each frame (spreads load across 4 frames)
2. **Spatial AI Culling**: Only agents within 50m of camera get AI updates
3. **Focus Agent Priority**: Focused agent always gets AI updates for responsive interaction
4. **Physics-Only Mode**: Non-AI agents continue previous actions without expensive decision making
5. **Real-time Configuration**: Toggle AI optimization on/off via web interface button
6. **Performance Monitoring**: Detailed AI optimization effectiveness tracking

üéØ **Expected Results**:
- **75% reduction** in AI processing time (from processing 100% to 25% of agents)
- **Agent AI Processing** should drop from 2.79ms to ~0.70ms per frame
- **Smooth interaction** maintained for focused agent
- **Configurable optimization** allows fine-tuning for different scenarios

üõ†Ô∏è **Controls Added**:
- **"üß† AI Opt: ON/OFF"** button for real-time toggling
- **API endpoint** `/ai_optimization_settings` for configuration
- **Performance reports** show AI optimization effectiveness

üí° **Next Steps for Further Optimization**:
- Monitor performance reports after rebuild to confirm AI optimization effectiveness
- If physics simulation becomes the new bottleneck, implement physics spatial partitioning
- Consider threaded AI processing for even better performance
