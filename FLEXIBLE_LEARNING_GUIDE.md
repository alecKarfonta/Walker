```

Then:
1. Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
2. Click on robots to see their learning controls
3. Use bulk controls in the Learning panel
4. Watch the leaderboard for approach icons
5. Monitor learning statistics

## 🧪 Advanced Usage

### API Endpoints

You can also control learning approaches programmatically:

```python
import requests

# Switch individual robot
requests.post('http://localhost:8080/switch_learning_approach', 
    json={'agent_id': 'robot_123', 'approach': 'survival_q_learning'})

# Bulk switch all robots  
requests.post('http://localhost:8080/bulk_switch_learning',
    json={'approach': 'enhanced_q_learning'})

# Get learning statistics
stats = requests.get('http://localhost:8080/learning_statistics').json()
```

### Performance Monitoring

The system automatically tracks:
- **Approach Distribution**: How many robots use each approach
- **Learning Performance**: Rewards, food consumption, survival time
- **Switching Success**: Success/failure rates of approach changes
- **Real-time Stats**: Updated every 5 seconds in the UI

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Immediate (Within 5 minutes)
- **Visual Differentiation**: Robots show different approach icons
- **Behavior Changes**: Survival robots start seeking food
- **Performance Gaps**: Enhanced robots outperform basic robots

### Short-term (15-30 minutes)  
- **Clear Performance Hierarchy**: Survival > Enhanced > Basic
- **Specialized Behaviors**: Food-seeking, energy management
- **Learning Stage Progression**: Basic movement → Food seeking → Mastery

### Long-term (1+ hours)
- **Optimized Strategies**: Each approach develops distinct patterns
- **Performance Convergence**: Best approaches dominate leaderboard
- **Ecosystem Effects**: Survival robots show complex interactions

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Learning approach doesn't switch**
- Check console for error messages
- Ensure robot is not destroyed
- Verify learning manager is initialized

**No performance difference**  
- Allow more time for learning (15+ minutes)
- Check that robots have different approaches in leaderboard
- Ensure ecosystem has food sources for survival learning

**UI controls not appearing**
- Click on a robot to focus it first
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Refresh the page if controls are missing

### Debug Information

Enable debug output:
```python
# In train_robots_web_visual.py, add debug flags
env.learning_manager.debug = True
```

### Performance Optimization

For large populations (50+ robots):
- Use bulk switching instead of individual switches
- Monitor memory usage during approach changes
- Consider limiting survival learning robots (more memory intensive)

## 📈 Future Enhancements
