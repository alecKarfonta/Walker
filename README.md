## Features

- **Physics Simulation**: Realistic 2D physics using Box2d
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Various implementations of Q-Learning with neural networks
- **Evolutionary Algorithm**: Population-based evolution with genetic operators
- **Real-time Visualization**: Pygame-based rendering with interactive debugging
- **Web Interface**: Browser-based visualization and control panel
- **Interactive GUI**: Parameter adjustment and simulation control
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time statistics and leaderboards

## What is Walker?

Walker is a machine learning simulation where populations of robots learn to walk through a combination of:
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Individual robots learn through trial and error
- **Evolutionary Algorithms**: Successful traits are passed to future generations
- **Neural Networks**: Robots use neural networks to make movement decisions
- **Physics Simulation**: Realistic physics constraints make walking a challenging task

Watch as robots evolve from clumsy attempts to efficient walkers over many generations!
