# Walker - An Autonomous AI Simulation

A 2D physics-based simulation for training autonomous agents using reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms.

ðŸš€ **Live Demo**: [https://mlapi.us/walker/](https://mlapi.us/walker/)

![Walker Simulation Example](docs/images/example_01.png)

## Core Features

*   **Physics-Based Simulation**: 2D environment powered by Box2D.
*   **Reinforcement Learning**: Features an Attention-based Deep Q-Learning model for agent decision-making.
*   **Evolutionary Algorithms**: Agent morphology (body structure) evolves over generations.
*   **Dynamic Environments**: The world is procedurally generated with changing terrain, obstacles, and resources.
*   **Efficient Agent Recycling**: A memory pool reuses agents to preserve learned knowledge.
*   **Web-Based Visualization**: Live monitoring and interaction via a Flask and Socket.IO interface.

## Getting Started
