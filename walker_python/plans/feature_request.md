- [x] Storage for reloading robots from persistent storage. Should include everything for reinstantiating the exact robot. Like the physical parameters, search, and q table. Along with performance metrics like distance traveled and max speed. Other metrics. 
  ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Complete robot persistence system with RobotStorage and StorageManager classes
  - Saves/loads physical parameters, Q-table state, learning parameters, and performance metrics
  - Supports snapshots, checkpoints, auto-save, and population management
  - Includes performance history tracking and robot similarity analysis
  - Demo script available at src/persistence/demo_usage.py

- [x] Reserve the elite every generation, restore them on load, limit the number stored in the db
  ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Elite Robot Preservation System with EliteManager class
  - Automatically preserves top 3 robots every generation during evolution
  - Database size limits with smart cleanup (max 150 elite robots by default)
  - Elite restoration capabilities for training resumption
  - Complete integration into training pipeline (trigger_evolution method)
  - Configurable settings: elite_per_generation, max_elite_storage, min_fitness_threshold
  - SQLite database for elite metadata with preservation history tracking
  - Compressed storage with automatic cleanup of oldest/weakest elites
  - API endpoints for web interface: /elite_statistics, /top_elites, /restore_elites
  - Test script available: test_elite_preservation.py
  - Full documentation: ELITE_PRESERVATION_README.md

- [ ] Improve performance by moving some operations off to other threads

- [ ] The robots should not kill eachother instantly.
