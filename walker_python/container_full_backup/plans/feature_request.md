# Comprehensive Q-Learning Improvement Plan
User Requests
- [ ] When I click a robot to focus on them the camera resets to an old position before moving to focus on the robot. Instead it should smoothly move from the current position to focus on the robot.

- [ ] After eating enough food have a robot resproduce a slightly modified offspring. Maintain a max population.

- [ ] Also ensure that the other learning approaches are restord, like the deep q learning, how do we transfer knowledge for those agents?

- [x] ‚úÖ After evolutionary step there are only omnivores!

**FIXED**: Added ecosystem role preservation system during evolution - roles are now inherited and diversity is maintained like learning approaches

- [x] ‚úÖ Food is being instantly consumed! Also when the food reachs 0 is does not disappear form the ui. Could be an issue with regeration never allowing them to get below the threshold for removal.

- [x] ‚úÖ When calculating a robots distance to the nearest food it should only consider food that is not depleted.

**FIXED**: Updated nearest food calculation to only consider resources with >0.1 amount (matching consumption threshold) 

**COMPLETELY FIXED**: 
1. **Consumption Speed**: Reduced from 0.5 to 0.1 per frame (~5x slower consumption)
2. **Energy Balance**: Adjusted energy calculations (0.1‚Üí0.2 multiplier, 2x‚Üí1.5x boost) 
3. **Zombie Resources Bug**: ELIMINATED regeneration system entirely! Now depleted resources are immediately removed and fresh ones spawned elsewhere
4. **Consumption Threshold**: Agents can only consume from resources with >0.1 amount, resources with ‚â§0.15 amount are automatically removed
5. **Update Frequency**: Ecosystem updates every 6 seconds (was 30s) to quickly clean up depleted resources  
6. **Energy Decay Bug**: Fixed critical bug where agents weren't losing energy (0.00001‚Üí0.0005 per frame = 50x increase)
7. **Overall Impact**: Clean resource system - no empty resources visible, proper survival ecosystem with realistic energy management

- [ ] Check for reward deviation in training data in deep q agent. If reward is always 0 there is a problem.


- [x] ‚úÖ Reserve the elite every generation, restore them on load, limit the number stored in the db
  ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED: Elite Robot Preservation System with EliteManager class
  - Automatically preserves top 3 robots every generation during evolution
  - Database size limits with smart cleanup (max 150 elite robots by default)
  - Elite restoration capabilities for training resumption
  - Complete integration into training pipeline (trigger_evolution method)
  - Configurable settings: elite_per_generation, max_elite_storage, min_fitness_threshold
  - SQLite database for elite metadata with preservation history tracking
  - Compressed storage with automatic cleanup of oldest/weakest elites
  - API endpoints for web interface: /elite_statistics, /top_elites, /restore_elites
  - Test script available: test_elite_preservation.py
  - Full documentation: ELITE_PRESERVATION_README.md

- [ ] Improve performance by moving some operations off to other threads

- [ ] The robots should not kill eachother instantly.

- [ ] Dont have each robot pick an action every frame, instead persist the previous action for 0.5s and only request the agent to condier a new action every interval
