```

## Alerting Setup

### üö® **Pre-configured Alerts**

The system automatically generates alerts for:

- **Poor Average Quality** - Score < 0.3 (Critical)
- **Sparse Rewards** - >30% of agents have sparse rewards (Warning)
- **Noisy Rewards** - >20% of agents have noisy rewards (Warning)

### Custom Alert Rules

Add these to Prometheus `alert.rules.yml`:

```yaml
groups:
- name: reward_signal_quality
  rules:
  - alert: RewardQualityTooLow
    expr: walker_reward_signals_avg_quality_score < 0.3
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "Reward signal quality is critically low"
      description: "Average reward quality score is {{ $value }}"

  - alert: TooManySparseRewards
    expr: walker_reward_signals_sparse_reward_agents > 10
    for: 2m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Many agents have sparse rewards"
      description: "{{ $value }} agents have sparse reward signals"
```

## Data Flow

```
Training Agents ‚Üí Reward Signals ‚Üí Evaluator ‚Üí Dashboard Exporter ‚Üí Prometheus ‚Üí Grafana
```

1. **Agents generate rewards** during training
2. **Reward Signal Adapter** captures signals non-intrusively
3. **Evaluator analyzes quality** every 100 samples per agent
4. **Dashboard Exporter** aggregates and exports to Prometheus format
5. **Prometheus scrapes metrics** every 15-30 seconds
6. **Grafana visualizes** real-time data with alerts

## Troubleshooting

### No Data in Grafana

**Possible Causes:**
1. Agents haven't started generating rewards yet
2. Prometheus not scraping correctly
3. Dashboard Exporter not running

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check if agents are training
curl http://localhost:7777/reward_signal_status

# Check Prometheus targets
curl "http://localhost:9889/api/v1/targets"

# Check dashboard exporter
curl http://localhost:2322/api/health
```

### Missing Metrics

**Check Prometheus Configuration:**
```bash
# Verify scraping config
docker exec walker-prometheus cat /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

**Restart services if needed:**
```bash
docker compose restart walker-prometheus walker-grafana
```

### Dashboard Import Issues

1. **Manual Panel Creation**: Use the Prometheus queries above
2. **Check Data Source**: Ensure Prometheus is configured in Grafana
3. **Verify Metrics**: Test queries in Prometheus web UI (http://localhost:9889)

## Best Practices

### üìà **Monitoring Workflow**

1. **Setup Dashboards** - Import or create reward signal quality panels
2. **Configure Alerts** - Set thresholds for quality score and issue counts
3. **Regular Review** - Monitor trends in quality metrics
4. **Issue Investigation** - Use diagnostics endpoints for detailed analysis
5. **Reward Tuning** - Adjust reward functions based on quality feedback

### üéØ **Quality Targets**

- **Excellent Quality**: Score > 0.8
- **Acceptable Quality**: Score > 0.6  
- **Needs Improvement**: Score < 0.4
- **Critical Issues**: Score < 0.2

### üîß **Optimization Tips**

1. **Monitor Early** - Check quality soon after training starts
2. **Watch Trends** - Quality should improve over time
3. **Balance Metrics** - Don't optimize for just one metric
4. **Use Alerts** - Set up notifications for quality degradation
5. **Regular Analysis** - Review quality reports weekly

## API Endpoints for Custom Dashboards

If you prefer to create custom dashboards or integrations:

```bash
# System Status
curl http://localhost:7777/reward_signal_status

# Quality Summary  
curl http://localhost:7777/reward_signal_summary

# Agent Diagnostics
curl http://localhost:7777/reward_signal_agent/<agent_id>/diagnostics

# Quality Comparison
curl http://localhost:7777/reward_signal_comparison

# Enhanced Performance (includes reward signals)
curl http://localhost:7777/performance_status
```

## Conclusion

Your Walker training system now provides comprehensive reward signal quality monitoring through Grafana. This enables you to:
